\textbf{Inner Products.} Let $(f, g)$ denote an inner product on a
suitable function space $S$, and let $f$ be a given function in $S$.
Suppose we want to approximate $f$ by a function \[s = \sum_{i=1}^n
\alpha_i \phi_i\] also in $S$. Recall that we have to solve a linear
system with a coefficient matrix $A$ whose $i,j$ entry is \[a_{i,j} =
(\phi_i, \phi_j).\] Show that $A$ is positive definite.
