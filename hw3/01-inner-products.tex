\textbf{Inner Products.} Let $(f, g)$ denote an inner product on a
suitable function space $S$, and let $f$ be a given function in $S$.
Suppose we want to approximate $f$ by a function \[s = \sum_{i=1}^n
\alpha_i \phi_i\] also in $S$. Recall that we have to solve a linear
system with a coefficient matrix $A$ whose $i,j$ entry is \[a_{i,j} =
(\phi_i, \phi_j).\] Show that $A$ is positive definite.

\[
\begin{aligned}
s &\approx f \\
s &\in S \\
s &= A x \\
\text{Therefore show that}
\Rightarrow \alpha^\intercal A \alpha &= 0 \\
\text{Where} (\alpha, A) \text{is the inner product of a function
space} S
\end{aligned}
\]
