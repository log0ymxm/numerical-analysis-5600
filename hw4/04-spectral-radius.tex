\textbf{(Spectral Radius.)} We saw that the spectral radius of a
(square) matrix $A$ never exceeds an induced matrix norm of $||A||$.
It can be shown that for any particular matrix $A$ one can find a
vector norm such that the induced matrix norm of $A$ is arbitrarily
close to the spectral radius of $A$. Does the spectral radius itself
define a norm? Why, or why not?
