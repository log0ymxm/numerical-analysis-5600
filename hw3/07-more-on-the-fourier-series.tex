\textbf{More on Fourier Series.} Calculate the Fourier series
of \[f(x) = \cos(x + 1).\] Hint: Before you embark on the computation
of a bunch of integrals think about what you would expect the Fourier
series to be. Perhaps you can find it without doing any integrals!

\begin{align*}
f(t) &= \cos(t+1) \\
     &= \cos(t) \cos(1) - \sin(t) \sin(1) \\
\end{align*}

Here the trigonometric identity of $\cos(x+y) = \cos(x)\cos(y)
- \sin(x)\sin(y)$ gives us a form equivalent to the Fourier series.

Solving for $a_n$ and $b_n$ we would find that
\[
a_n = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
\cos(1) &\,\,\, \text{if}\,\, n = 1 \\
0 &\,\,\, \text{if}\,\, n \ne 1
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]
and
\[
b_n = \left\{
\begin{aligned}
-\sin(1) &\,\,\, \text{if}\,\, n = 1 \\
0 &\,\,\, \text{if}\,\, n \ne 1
\end{aligned}
\right.
\]

Thus the Fourier series for $f(t)$ is
\[
F(t) = \cos(1)\cos(t) - \sin(1)\sin(t)
\]
