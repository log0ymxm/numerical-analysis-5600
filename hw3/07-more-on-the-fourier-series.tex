\textbf{More on Fourier Series.} Calculate the Fourier series
of \[f(x) = \cos(x + 1).\] Hint: Before you embark on the computation
of a bunch of integrals think about what you would expect the Fourier
series to be. Perhaps you can find it without doing any integrals!

\[
\begin{aligned}
f(n) &= \cos(n+1) \\
     &= \cos(1) \cos(n) - \sin(1) \sin(n) \\
a_{0} &=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\cos(x+1)dx\\
	&=\frac{\sin(1)\sin(n\pi))}{\pi(n^2-1)}\\
	&=0\\
a_{n} &=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\cos(x+1)\cos(nx)dx\\
	&=\frac{2\sin(1)\sin(n\pi))}{\pi(n^2-1)}\\
	&=0\\
b_{n} &=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\cos(x+1)\sin(nx)dx\\
	&=\frac{-2n\cos(1)\sin(n\pi))}{\pi(n^2-1)}\\
	&=0\\
