\textbf{More on Fourier Series.} Calculate the Fourier series
of \[f(x) = \cos(x + 1).\] Hint: Before you embark on the computation
of a bunch of integrals think about what you would expect the Fourier
series to be. Perhaps you can find it without doing any integrals!

 \[f(n) = \cos(n + 1).\]

$a_{0}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\cos x+1 dx$ ~\\  ~\\
$a_{n}=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\cos (x+1)\cos(nx)dx$ ~\\ ~\\
$b_{n}=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\cos (x+1)\sin(nx)dx$ ~\\ ~\\
Fourier Series  =  $a_{0}+\sum (a_{n}cos(nx)+b_{n}sin(nx))$
