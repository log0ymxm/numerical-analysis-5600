\textbf{(Spectral Radius.)} We saw that the spectral radius of a
(square) matrix $A$ never exceeds an induced matrix norm of $\|A\|$.
It can be shown that for any particular matrix $A$ one can find a
vector norm such that the induced matrix norm of $A$ is arbitrarily
close to the spectral radius of $A$. Does the spectral radius itself
define a norm? Why, or why not?

\begin{align*}
\text{Consider } 0 &=\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0\\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix} \\
\text{and } A &=
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1\\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix}\\
\end{align*}

Clearly, $A \neq 0$, the eigenvalues of the zero matrix $0$ and $A$ are $0$ and $0$
respectively.
\begin{align*}
\Rightarrow \rho(A) &= \rho(0) \\
&= \max \{0,0\}
\end{align*}
By definition, a norm requires the property $\|A\| = 0 \Rightarrow A = 0$
Here, we have $\rho(A)=0$, but $A \neq 0$
Therefore, $\rho$ is \textit{not} a matrix norm.
