\textbf{The interpolant to symmetric data is symmetric.} Suppose you
are given symmetric data \[(x_i, y_i), \;\;\; i= -n, -n+1, \dots, n-1,
n\] such that \[x_{-i} = -x_i, \;\;\; \text{and} \;\; y_{-i} = -y_i
\;\;\; i=0,1,\dots,n.\]
What is the required degree of the interpolating polynomial $p$? Show
that the interpolating polynomial is odd, i.e. \[p(x) = -p(-x)\] for
all real numbers $x$.
