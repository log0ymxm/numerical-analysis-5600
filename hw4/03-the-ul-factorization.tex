\textbf{(The $UL$ factorization.)} Show how to compute the
factorization $A = UL$ where $U$ is upper triangular with $1$s along
the diagonal and $L$ is lower triangular. Show how this relates to a
way of solving $Ax=b$ by transforming the system into an equivalent
system with a lower triangular matrix. (In other words, show that what
we did for the $LU$ factorization also works for a $UL$
factorization.) Note: For the purposes of this exercise you may assume
that no pivoting is required. This is of course unrealistic but
pivoting would only distract from the point of this exercise (which is
that conceptually there is no difference between an $LU$ and a $UL$
factorization).

Consider the permutation matrix, $P$ s.t.
$A^{T}=PAP^{T}$
Then, $PP^{T}=P^{T}P=I$
Consider $A^{T}=PAP^{T}=L_0U_0$, where $L_0U_0$ is the LU decomposition of $A^{T}$
If $U=L_{0}^{T}$ and $L=U_{0}^{T}$, $L_0U_0=PUP^{T}PLP^{T}=PULP^{T}=PAP^{T}$
$\Rightarrow A=UL$ Since $U$ and $L$ both have $1$'s along the diagonals,
$Ax=ULx=b$ can be written as $Lx=y$, and $Uy=b$.
