\textbf{(First Order Systems.)} Write the second order initial value
problem
\begin{aligned}
y^{\prime\prime} &= xy^2 \\
y(0) &= 1 \\
y^\prime(0) &= 2
\end{aligned}
as an autonomous first order system
\begin{aligned}
  y^\prime &= f(y)\\
y(a) &= y_0.
\end{aligned}
(In other words, specify $y$, $f$, $a$, and $y_0$ such that the two
problems are equivalent. Of course, $y$ will have different meanings
for the two problems.)
