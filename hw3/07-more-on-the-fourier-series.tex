\textbf{More on Fourier Series.} Calculate the Fourier series
of \[f(x) = \cos(x + 1).\] Hint: Before you embark on the computation
of a bunch of integrals think about what you would expect the Fourier
series to be. Perhaps you can find it without doing any integrals!

\[
\begin{aligned}
f(n) &= \cos(n+1) \\
     &= \cos(1) \cos(n) - \sin(1) \sin(n) \\
F(n) &= ? % TODO
\end{aligned}
\]
