\textbf{(Improper Integrals.)} Let \[
I = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{\ln (x^2 + 1 )}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} dx = 2 \pi \ln
\left[ \frac{1 + \sqrt{2}}{2} \right].
\]
This integral is improper because the integrand approaches infinity as
$x$ approaches $\pm 1$. Attempt to approximate this integral by using
Simpson's Rule (or any other Newton-Cotes formula) on the interval
$[-1 + \epsilon, 1 - \epsilon]$ for small $\epsilon > 0$. Describe the
results of your efforts. Then, for $n = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$, use the
Gaussian Quadrature formula \[
\int_{-1}^1 \frac{f(x)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} dx = \frac{\pi}{n}
\sum_{i=1}^n f\left( \cos \left( \frac{(2i - 1) \pi}{2n} \right) \right)
\] which we discussed in class. Compute the error and discuss your results.
