\textbf{More on the Recurrence Relation.} Remember that a key property
of the inner products for which we established the three term relation
was that $(xf,g) = (f,xg)$. Find an inner product that violates that
rule, and for which the recurrence relation does indeed fail to yield
orthogonal polynomials. (Thus use the recurrence relation to construct
the first few polynomials, until you find two that are not orthogonal.)

\[
\begin{aligned}
(xf, g) \ne (f, xg) \\
\int_a^b (x f(t)) g(t) \textrm{d}t \ne \int_a^b f(t) (x g(t)) \textrm{d}t
\end{aligned}
\]

% TODO try the inner product (f,g)+(f',g') where (f,g) is the usual
% non-weighted integral
