\textbf{The interpolant to symmetric data is symmetric.} Suppose you
are given symmetric data \[(x_i, y_i), \;\;\; i= -n, -n+1, \dots, n-1,
n\] such that \[x_{-i} = -x_i, \;\;\; \text{and} \;\; y_{-i} = -y_i
\;\;\; i=0,1,\dots,n.\]
What is the required degree of the interpolating polynomial $p$? Show
that the interpolating polynomial is odd, i.e. \[p(x) = -p(-x)\] for
all real numbers $x$.

Since we have a symmetric dataset the number of points is even and
equals $2n + 2$ ($n=0$ gives us $(x_0, y_0), (x_{-0}, y_{-0})$ which still has $2$ points). Thus the interpolated polynomial will be of degree
$2n + 1$ which is odd.

Interpolating symmetric data will give us the unique polynomial $p_n(x_i) =
y_i$ which passes through all points in our data set $x_i$, and $y_i$.

This means that we have
\begin{align*}
p_n(x_i) &= y_i \\
          &= -(-y_i) \\
          &= -y_{-i} \\
          &= - p_n(x_{-i}) \\
          &= - p_n(-x_i) \\
\Rightarrow p(x_i) &= -p(-x_i) \,\,\, \text{for all } i = 0,1,2,\dots,n
\end{align*}
