\textbf{The Three Term Recurrence Relation} Let the inner product
$(f,g)$ be defined by \[(f,g) = \int_a^b w(x) f(x) g(x) \mathrm{d}x\]
(where $w$ is a positive weight function). Prove that the sequence of
polynomials defined by
\[
\begin{aligned}
Q_n &= (x - a_n) Q_{n-1} - b_n Q_{n-2} \\
Q_0 &= 1 \\
Q_1 &= x - a_n \\
a_n &= \frac{(x Q_{n-1}, Q_{n-1})}{(Q_{n-1}, Q_{n-1})} \\
b_n &= \frac{(x Q_{n-1}, Q_{n-2})}{(Q_{n-2}, Q_{n-2})}
\end{aligned}
\]
is orthogonal with respect to (3). Note that the proof of this fact
uses the property \[(xf, g) = (f, xg)\] of (3).
